### Hi there 👋

About me :scream:

My name is Luis Felipe Somensi from Brazil (🇧🇷).I'm a first-year high school student attending Colégio Sagrado Coração de Jesus BG.

In my free time I like to play (and watch) and watch soccer, to watch formula 1 (🏎️),  hang out with my friends, and play video games.


Would you like to find me?
